---- MCVP ----
- Finish the following of the steps in steb by step component
- (interactive) Add evaluation result 
- Store prepared sets as DAG
- Add center button

- Fix (interactive) max children 2 - check if this constrain is valid 
- Fix (manual) error messages -> missing parentasises, but not on the end gives error wrong chars at the end,  

- Display numbers on edges when node is selected and then use these numbers in the delete butons 
- Optimize - space between nodes
- Optimize - initial placement of tree in canvas (tree is in upper left corner and not centered)
- Optimize - ids of nodes icrement when AND or OR added 

- Look into react-d3-tree for tree layout in MCVP 

---- CG ----
- Remake the isWinning property to hold players id
- Add highlight of the selected node (in manual)
- Add center button
- Allow edges to be longer

---- Grammar ----

- Optimize - (manual) make the text area as big as the content automaticly 


---- Global ----
- Optimize using the useCallback 
- Optimize using loaders  
- Look into deleting file loader files - propably more optimal to import the data sets directly with import key word 
- Rewrite css to bootstrap
- Set grabing cursor on canvas and clickable on the node
- add little bit of space to pages where content is touching the bottom of the page
