---- MCVP ----
- Fix - when user clicks on the explain button, it recalculates the derived word 
- Fix - placement of the explain button should be like in other problems under all page content
- Fix - in MCVP to CG disable the button to end or to beginnig if the user is at the end or begining of the conversion

- Optimize - the nodes are still overlaping, when there are more children - find a way to idealy place all the nodes at the begining
- Optimize (interactive) - make highlight style of nodes and edges same as TreeRenderCanvas
- Optimize (generated) - advanced options can be added (max/min num of children ) 
- Optimize - make just the variables smaller to fit the nodes, operations can stay the same

---- CG ----
- Fix - make cycles in graph possible
- Fix the evaluating alg, its enough to have one winnig strategy to evaluate that the player I have winnig strategy
- Fix display of the optimal moves (the whole path should be highlighted)

---- Grammar ----
- Check if epsilon counts as empty grammar 
- Optimize - adjust the node radius for the longer words
- Optimize - (manual) make the text area as big as the content automaticly 

---- Global ----
- Add autoscroll after selecting set or genererating and displaying some data 
- Add fixed positions for nodes when exporting some graph + position the graph when provided with fixed positions

- Bonus - implemnt dynamic size of display component, user can resize the coimponent manually (by pulling the edge or + / - buttons)
