---- MCVP ----
- Finish the following of the steps in steb by step component
- Store prepared sets as DAG
- Add center button

- Fix (interactive) possible to connect two nodes in both directions at the same time  
- Fix (interactive) convert graph structure to structer needed in evaluateTree
- Fix (interactive) max children 2 - check if this constrain is valid 
- Fix (manual) error messages -> missing parentasises, but not on the end gives error wrong chars at the end,  

- (interactive) Display numbers on edges when node is selected and then use these numbers in the delete butons 
- Optimize (generated) - advanced options can be added (max/min num of children ) 
- Optimize - space between nodes
- Optimize - initial placement of tree in canvas (tree is in upper left corner and not centered)
- Optimize - ids of nodes icrement when AND or OR added 

- Look into react-d3-tree for tree layout in MCVP 

---- CG ----
- Remake the isWinning property to hold players id
- Add highlight of the selected node (in manual)
- Add center button
- Allow edges to be longer

---- Grammar ----

- Optimize - (manual) make the text area as big as the content automaticly 


---- Global ----
- Add autoscroll after selecting set or genererating and displaying some data 
- Optimize max and min value of input parameters from user
- Optimize display structure in the center of the canvas
- Optimize using the useCallback 
- Optimize using loaders  
- Rewrite css to bootstrap
- Set grabing cursor on canvas and clickable on the node
- Add little bit of space to pages where content is touching the bottom of the page

- Add conversion from MCVP to CG
- Add conversion from MCVP to Grammar
- Add conversion from CG to MCVP
- Add conversion from CG to Grammar
- Add conversion from Grammar to MCVP
- Add conversion from Grammar to CG


Finish the transition after NodeClass refactoring (jsx files and Generator.js and EvaluateTree.js)
