---- MCVP ----
- Optimize - the nodes are still overlaping, when there are more children - find a way to idealy place all the nodes at the begining
- Optimize (interactive) - make highlight style of nodes and edges same as TreeRenderCanvas
- Optimize (generated) - advanced options can be added (max/min num of children ) 
- Optimize - make just the variables smaller to fit the nodes, operations can stay the same

---- CG ----
- Fix the evaluating alg, its enough to have one winnig strategy to evaluate that the player I have winnig strategy
- Fix display of the optimal moves (the whole path should be highlighted)

---- Grammar ----
- Check if epsilon counts as empty grammar 
- Optimize - adjust the node radius for the longer words
